# Mountain Climber

## 1. Game Objects/Things
#### Icicle
This will be my static object that, if the user touches, will fall off and die. It will
stick out along the wall, making the user jump across to avoid it.

#### Bird
The bird will fly across the screen randomly, probably along a slightly curved path. If
the user touches during gameplay, then they will fall and lose the game. The bird should be
a simple image imported into the program.

#### Goat
The goat will act like a "bonus" to add to the users score if they user collides with the goat.
There will be a rope that goes between the two walls on each side of the window and
the goat will move across this rope. The goat as well as the rope (two separate objects) should
be simple images imported into the program. (The user will be able to go through the rope)

#### Snow Monkey
The snow monkey will move jump across each side of the screen (or each wall of the mountain),
making it difficult to catch. It will be relatively small, and will climb the mountain also,
avoiding obstacles. If the user catches (or collides) with it, then the user will be "invincible"
for a certain time/height (being unaffected by birds and icicles) as they would run through/clip
the things that normally would make them fall. The snow monkey will not show up very often and
will be from an imported image.

## 2. Gameplay
Gameplay will be controlled just by the space bar where the character will switch sides
(going from wall to wall on each side) upon press. The player will need to switch sides
in order to avoid enemies or obstacles that will cause them to fall. The player will be running
up the "mountain" or screen during game play, which will increase in speed as the user gets
higher up the mountain.

----

## 3. Score Tracking
Score will be tracked by how high the player gets (the higher up the mountain, the higher the score).
There will also be goats to add bonuses to the score.

## 4. Player Life Tracking
Right now, I do not plan on giving lives. When the player falls or touches an enemy, they die and the game ends.
If I need to give them lives, they will respawn from the height (which will be kept track of) where
they had fallen off from.
