# Ice Climber

## 1. Game Objects/Things
#### Icicle
This will be my static object that, if the user touches, will fall off and die. It will
stick out along the wall, making the user jump across to avoid it.

#### Bird
The bird will fly across the screen randomly, probably along a slightly curved path. If
the user touches during gameplay, then they will fall and lose the game.

#### Goat
The goat will act like a "bonus" to add to the users score if they user collides with the goat.
There will be a "string" that goes between the two walls on each side of the window and
the goat will move across this string.

#### Object 1

## 2. Gameplay
Gameplay will be controlled just by the space bar where the character will switch sides
(going from wall to wall on each side) upon press. The player will need to switch sides
in order to avoid enemies or obstacles that will cause them to fall.

----

## 3. Score Tracking
Score will be tracked by how high the player gets (the higher up the mountain, the higher the score).
There will also be goats to add bonuses to the score.

## 4. Player Life Tracking
Right now, I do not plan on giving lives. When the player falls or touches an enemy, they die and the game ends.
If I need to give them lives, they will respawn from the height (which will be kept track of) where
they had fallen off from.
